# Order Book Server-Send-Event

Welcome to your Go project! This project demonstrates how to create a simple server that sends Server-Sent Events (SSE) with JSON data to a web client. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go (1.13 or higher)
- Web browser (for viewing the SSE messages)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-go-project.git
  ```

2. Running the server

  Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
  Run the following command to start the Go server:

  ```sh
  cd your-go-project

  go run main.go
  ```
  This will start the server at `http://localhost:9001`.
  you can open the html file on your browser or use the server on your own client.
